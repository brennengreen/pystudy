Virtual Index Cards w/ Python & Tkinter!

## Study Sets
Study sets are .txt files used to create the questions in pystudy. These questions can be anything you want!
The only requirement is the format of these questions!

*ALWAYS* format questions with the following:
`QUESTION:ANSWER` and then finish the line with a new line/enter. Every question:answer must be on its own line.

(Check the examples for more information!)
